# `inversion_modules/` — pipeline deployment root

Consolidated deployment tree for the inversion-discovery pipeline of
the `MS_Inversions_North_african_catfish` manuscript. Cohort: 226
*Clarias gariepinus* broodstock individuals sampled from a commercial
Thai hatchery that maintains broodstock for F₁ hybrid catfish seed
production (*C. macrocephalus* ♀ × *C. gariepinus* ♂); pure-species
identity was verified at the read level by Mash screening against both
parental subgenomes (see
`Modules/MODULE_1_read_prep/helpers/MODULE_1_Methods_Revised.md` §1.2).
Sequencing: ~9× Illumina short-read WGS. Reference: the *C. gariepinus*
(Gar) subgenome reference (`fClaHyb_Gar_LG.fa`, 28 pseudochromosomes,
~964 Mb) extracted from Section 1 of the manuscript's haplotype-resolved
F₁ hybrid assembly. K clusters in this cohort reflect hatchery broodline
structure (20+ small families), not interspecies or natural-population
structure. All paths below are relative to this directory.

## Catalog birth — where candidates become first-class objects

`phase_4/4a/STEP_C01d_candidate_scoring` is the pipeline's pivot. At
the moment it runs:

1. Reads the primary boundary track (staircase blocks from
   `phase_2/2d_candidate_detection/`, bridge-converted to
   `triangle_intervals.tsv.gz`)
2. Reads evidence from whichever of these are available, as scoring
   dimensions (not gates):
   - `--cores_dir` → seeded regions from `phase_2/2c_precomp/STEP_C01b_1`
   - `--boundary_dir` → `boundary_catalog_unified.tsv.gz` from C01g
     (built from 5 boundary sources)
   - `--hyp_dir` → hypothesis verdicts from C01f (when available — a
     second C01d pass after 4c)
3. Computes 12 scoring dimensions D1–D12, assigns Tier 1/2/3/4
4. Writes `candidate_scores.tsv.gz` — **the catalog**

Still owed: a `create_candidate_folders.sh` that materialises
per-candidate folder structure (`01_detection/`, `02_genotypes/`,
`04_breakpoints/`, `05_mechanism/`, `06_evolution/`) from the catalog.
Previous chats describe this running right after C01d; it is not in
the current deployment. Downstream (`phase_4/4b`..`4e`) still works
without it — the scripts read the flat catalog directly — but the
per-candidate folder layout that older launchers expect is absent.

## The two tracks in phase 2

Both tracks produce candidate blocks. They are designed to fail on
different kinds of noise — a candidate visible to both is higher
confidence than one visible to only one.

| Track | Primary signal | Seed / start | Folder |
|---|---|---|---|
| Matrix-based (staircase) | vote-based boundaries across row profiles of sim_mat | step-down votes across row profiles | `2d_candidate_detection/` |
| Seed-based (seeded regions) | MDS z-outlier extension under damage budget | MDS z-score outliers | `2c_precomp/STEP_C01b_1_seeded_regions.R` |

The matrix track is **primary** — it runs `run_all.R` (9 phases) per
chromosome and converts its output to the legacy
`triangle_intervals.tsv.gz` format that C01d reads. The seed track is
internal evidence — C01d consumes its output via `--cores_dir` as one
of its scoring dimensions.

### Historical note — no merge step in phase 2

An earlier design had a `2d_seeded_merge/` folder with
`STEP_C01b_2_merge.R` that used 1D fuzzy max-min composition to
consolidate seeded regions before scoring. It was dropped because it
overmerged across real boundaries visible in the 2D sim_mat (LG19, LG28
during testing). The replacement is: two parallel boundary detectors
(staircase in `2d_candidate_detection/`, PHASE_01C in `2c_precomp/`)
feeding phase 4 directly. The retired script is at
`_archive_superseded/fuzzy_merge_abandoned/` with its own README.

## Phase 4 — validation levels

Phase 4 is organised around validation levels that gate downstream
tests. Groups (HOM_REF, HET, HOM_INV, RECOMBINANT) are proposed by
C01i (phase 4b), validated by C01f (phase 4c), and consumed by
group-dependent tests (phase 4d):

```
NONE        phase 4a — scoring / figures / boundaries; no groups required
UNCERTAIN   phase 4b — groups proposed from PCA; composite intervals cap here
SUPPORTED   phase 4c — family-restricted or few-family verdicts
VALIDATED   phase 4c — robust multi-family verdicts
SUSPECT     phase 4c — pca_family_confounded only
```

The four-way jackknife semantics (v10.1.1) treats
`single_family_fragile` as REAL (family-restricted polymorphism), not
SUSPECT. See `phase_4_postprocessing/docs/DESIGN_NOTE_K_and_local_Q_and_jackknife.md`.

## The 4-layer independence framework

| Layer | Source | Algorithm | Produced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | dosage (genotype likelihoods) | lostruct local PCA → MDS | `phase_2/2a` + `2b` |
| B | SV caller output | DELLY2 + Manta catalogs | `phase_2/2c/STEP_C00` |
| C | Clair3 phased genotypes | GHSL haplotype contrast | `phase_2/2e_ghsl` |
| D | genotype–breakpoint association | Fisher odds ratio linking A, B, C | `phase_4` |

Layers are designed to fail independently. Tier 1 = multi-layer
convergence; Tier 3–4 = single-layer evidence or layer-specific
artefact.

## Deployment check

```bash
python3 check_deployment_v10.py
```

Reports on files present, JSON schemas parsing, R bracket balance,
Python syntax, schema cross-references, registry loader smoke, and
runs the 5 test suites in `phase_4_postprocessing/tests/`.

The `registries/` API + schema directory lives at the repo root
(`inversion-popgen-toolkit/registries/`), not inside this tree — the
deployment-check errors about missing registry files are expected in
this configuration. The 5 tests all pass.

## Still owed

1. Real `Rscript --vanilla -e 'parse(file=...)'` on LANTA for every R
   file, especially the allowlisted ones (naive bracket counter false-
   positives on ggplot dict-arg + complex string literals).
2. Bump `hypothesis_verdict.schema.json` to v2 (add `family_linkage`
   enum + `quality_flags` field) to match v10.1.1 semantics.
3. One-chromosome smoke test through 2c → 2d → phase_3 → 4a → 4b → 4c
   (suggested target: LG12 with the Tier-1 candidate at 52.4–54.6 Mb
   from earlier manuscript drafts).
4. `ancestry_bridge.R --prepare` for all 28 chromosomes before the
   first C01a run (produces `local_Q/<chr>.local_Q_samples.tsv.gz`
   cache read by `nested_composition`).
5. Wire C01f call sites to the new `compute_group_validation()` list
   return (`$level`, `$quality_flags`, `$family_linkage`) instead of
   the pre-v10.1.1 string return.
6. `create_candidate_folders.sh` — the script that materialises
   per-candidate folder structure (`01_detection/`, `02_genotypes/`,
   `04_breakpoints/`, `05_mechanism/`, `06_evolution/`) from
   `candidate_scores.tsv.gz`. Described in past chats, not present in
   this deployment. Low priority — phase 4b–4e consume the flat catalog
   directly.
7. Cross-module rename pass (post-manuscript) to retire remaining
   `cheatNN`/`snake`/`core` terminology in phase_4 and MODULE_5B–E
   consumers. See `2c_precomp/RENAMING.md` section 13 for the
   up-to-date remaining list. Note: C01d's output column names
   `d12_snake_concordance` and `snake_overlap` are consumed by
   `4e/compute_candidate_status.R` and `test_registry_sanity.py` —
   renaming them is a coordinated change across those three files.
